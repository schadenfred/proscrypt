# ProScrypt Koans

## Introduction

My name is Fred. Welcome to my koans. My goal is for them to be the best way an intelligent person can answer the question: "Do I like developing software?" If you like developing, no matter how bad you suck everything, how slow you learn, and how much better other people are at programming than you at first, you'll keep at it, and eventually become productive -- and find meaning.

Your goals might not be the same as mine, and that's fine.

Maybe you're a project manager who wants to understand when the neckbearded shits she works with are shining her on. Or maybe you're in prison, looking for something to pass the time: An enlisted Marine standing watch on a nuclear submarine; a bartender with too much college debt; one of those emo kids in high school who hates football and cheerleaders, and wears axe body spray, and vapes in the bathroom between classes; a Dad with three kids by two different baby Mommas, who doesn't want them to grow up on food stamps. Maybe you're homeless. Shit, maybe you're one of those beauty-queen-trophy-wives who's always been quiet, and perfect, and who nobody ever thought was smart, but yesterday some skank threw shade on your Jimmy Choo's, and now you're going to show that ugly slut what is the mothafucking what. Your motivation doesn't matter because your code doesn't give a shit. Your code either works or it doesn't. It doesn't have feelings. Your code won't care how old you are, where you live, what car you drive, what your SAT score was, or if you're good at math or science. You won't need a credit card and you won't need to be smart. Let me say that again:

You do not need to be smart.

What you do need is a few hour-long blocks of uninterrupted time to get started, a good attitude, some unhealthy curiosity, some obsessiveness, some stubbornness, the humility to ask people for help when you're stuck, a little bit of anger, and the ability focus and to pay attention to detail. I've found coffee, ephedrine, and Adderall useful at different times in the past. Because this tutorial and these koans are really hard, and computers and software and other developers will make you feel stupid. They make me feel stupid every day. I wish I knew how to help you find out if you like developing without making you feel stupid. But I do know that if you finish these koans, nobody will be happier for you than me.

Not even your Mom.

### koans

What's a koan? Here's one definition of a koan that seems legit:

> A paradox to be meditated upon that is used to train Zen Buddhist monks to abandon ultimate dependence on reason and to force them into gaining sudden intuitive enlightenment

I'm no Zen Buddhist monk, and don't want you to abandon reason, but I dislike lecturing -- that's not how I learn -- and so will give you a problem to solve, and let you figure out how to solve it, and then when you've solved it, you will move onto the next koan. I'm not going to teach you anything, you're going to teach yourself.

If you're having trouble with a koan, look for the blue link to "reflect" on it further.

### Your first koan

The site you're reading these koans on is all about managing different versions, or branches, of a codebase, or any group of files, known as a repository. The koans are organized into different chapters corresponding to different versions of the code in our repo. Click around to get a feel for the site, and when you've figured out how to change the "branch" of this repo to "chapter-1," do so.
